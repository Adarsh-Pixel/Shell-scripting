#Loops are used to execute something for certain number of times

#There are two types of loops :
#   1) For Loop     : (When you know something to be executed n number of time, we use for loop)
#   2) While Loop   : (When you don't know something to be executed n number of times, we use while loop)


# For loop syntax
for val in 10 20 30 40 50 ; do 
    echo "value for the loop is $val"
done
